In this past year, the freshmen representative campaign finance records for Pramila Jayapal show some very interesting figures. 
For the most part, the majority of the fundraising for her own campaign was supported by individual donations with 75% of the money raised by these donations.
Twenty five percent of the individual donations were from small individual contributions. Fifty five percent of the over all individual contributions were from large individual contributions. 
Pacâ€™s covered about 25% of the fundraising for her freshman year campaign. What is interesting is that Jayapal contributed no money to her campaign. Traditionally, the lack of contribution from the candidate in there own campaign was very common. 
Only very wealthy government officials would spend money on their own campaign and even when they did, the percentages were very low. But after Donald Trumps finance campaign report surfaced which show a lower percentage of super pacs used then Hilary Clinton and higher percentages used of his own money, the candidate self-fundraisings/involvement has become an interesting focus.
From the 635,464 money raised, the candidate spent only 160,087. 
These figures obviously seem low compared to other bigger campaigns. But the amount of money raised for a Washington state representative is still impressive.
